Imagine you’re working on payments team. Customer subscribes to Products and is interested in exploring how much it’ll cost them to keep using the product for the rest of the year.

Your task is to develop a Cost Explorer that calculates the total cost a customer has to pay in a unit year. This means that at any day of the year they should be able to get a provisional report giving monthly/yearly cost estimates.

Cost Explorer should be able to provide a report of -

Monthly cost (Generate a bill for each month, including bill amount for future months for the unit year) -
Yearly cost estimates (for the unit year)
// Atlassian pricing plans -
[
{BASIC, 9.99},
{STANDARD, 49.99},
{PREMIUM, 249.99}
]

Follow up:
If there is trial period incoporate in calculation of bill

CGPT

When approaching this problem, consider the following:

Data Modeling: Design classes or data structures to represent subscription plans, including attributes like level, start month, and monthly cost.

Cost Computation Logic: Implement logic to calculate the total cost over 12 months, taking into account any changes in subscription levels or costs.

Edge Cases: Handle scenarios such as mid-year subscription changes, promotional discounts, or free trial periods.

Extensibility: Design the system to easily accommodate new subscription models or pricing rules in the future.
