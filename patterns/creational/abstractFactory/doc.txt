Perfect — let’s dive into the Abstract Factory Pattern, one of the most frequently asked patterns in Low-Level Design interviews, especially when dealing with families of related objects.

🏭🔧 Abstract Factory Pattern – Overview
✅ Intent:
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

🧱 Key Components

Role	Description
AbstractFactory	Interface for creating abstract products
ConcreteFactory	Implements creation methods to return concrete products
AbstractProduct	Common interface for a family of products
ConcreteProduct	Actual implementations of abstract products
Client	Uses only interfaces; doesn't care which factory or product is used
🎯 Real-World Analogy
Imagine you're building a cross-platform UI toolkit. You want to support:

Windows UI

Mac UI

Each platform has its own version of:

Button

TextBox

You use an abstract factory to produce the right set based on the platform.


====================================================================
in the Abstract Factory pattern, you can use a static method to select and return the appropriate concrete factory. This is actually a very common and practical enhancement of the pattern, especially when your client needs a simple way to choose the factory at runtime.

Using a static method to select the concrete factory:

Does not break the Abstract Factory pattern.

Simplifies usage for the client.

Keeps object creation centralized without losing polymorphism.
