The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern used to pass a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides either to:

Handle the request, or

Pass it to the next handler in the chain.

✅ Key Concepts

Component	Description
Handler (abstract class or interface)	Declares a method to handle the request and a reference to the next handler.
Concrete Handlers	Each handler decides whether to process the request or forward it.
Client	Initiates the request and passes it to the first handler.


=============================

🧠 Real-World Use Cases

Use Case	How it Fits
Event Handling Systems	UI events bubbling from child to parent components (e.g., DOM in JS)
Middleware Pipelines	Like Express.js or Java Servlet filters: request flows through middleware chain
Customer Support Chatbot	Low-level bot → agent → manager → admin
Authentication Handlers	TokenAuth → BasicAuth → SSOAuth
Spam Filter Chain	Check for virus → phishing → ad spam → content spam
✅ Advantages
Loose coupling between sender and receiver

Flexible flow of request handling

Easy to add/remove handlers

❌ Disadvantages
Can be hard to debug

Risk of unhandled requests if no handler processes it

May lead to long chains if not structured well
